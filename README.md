The repository publishes the document archive to the Github Pages website, providing a quick start for new members of CGRG.

## Modify the website and view the changes locally
### First use
1. Install git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Install python through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
3. If your operating system is Windows, please open "Anaconda Powershell Prompt" (if your operating system is Linux, please open "terminal") and use `cd` command to change the current working directory to the directory you want.
   - For example, if you prefer to manage all your projects in the `D:\project\` directory, then you can use `cd D:\project\` in "Anaconda Powershell Prompt" to change the current working directory to `D:\project\`.
4. In "Anaconda Powershell Prompt", use the following command to clone the repository on github.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/CGRG-lab/doc-archive.git
   ```
5. In "Anaconda Powershell Prompt", use the following command to change the current working directory to the `doc-archive` directory.
   ```shell
   cd doc-archive
   ```
6. In "Anaconda Powershell Prompt", use the following command to create the python environment of `doc-archive`.
    ```shell
    conda env update --prune --file environment.yml
    ```
7. In "Anaconda Powershell Prompt", use the following command to activate `doc-archive` environment.
    ```shell
    conda activate doc-archive
    ```
8. In "Anaconda Powershell Prompt", use the following command to serve the website locally.
    ```shell
    mkdocs serve
    ```
